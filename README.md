Introduction
------------

Promiscuous is designed to facilitate designing a
[service-oriented architecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture)
in Ruby.

In order for a service-oriented system to be successful, services *must* be
loosely coupled. Using a common database goes against this principle. Each
service in the system has its own dedicated database. This way, each
application can denormalize and transform data at will.

Promiscuous replicates the data around the system. Each application can publish
and subscribe to application models. Promiscuous supports Mongoid3 and
ActiveRecord (partially). It relies on [RabbitMQ](http://www.rabbitmq.com/) to
distribute data around and [Redis](http://redis.io/) to synchronize and order
operations.

Promiscuous guarantees that the subscriber never sees out of order updates.
This property considerably reduces the complexity of applications.

This constraint removes any hopes of subscribing directly to the database oplog
as it wouldn't know the ordering of operations when using shards, which is
one of the limitations of [MoSQL](https://github.com/stripe/mosql).

Essentially, Promiscuous is a record/replay system built on top the ActiveModel API.
The recording is done on the publisher side, and replayed asynchronously on subscribers.

Rails Quick Tutorial
--------------------

### 1. Preparation

We need to few things for the promiscuous tutorial:

* The AMQP broker [RabbitMQ](http://www.rabbitmq.com/) 2.8.7 (not 3.x because of a bug in the ruby driver) up and running.
* The key-value storage system [Redis](http://redis.io/) up and running.
* Two rails applications with the promiscuous gem installed.
* Both applications must be running on separate databases.
* Both applications must have a User model (ActiveRecord or Mongoid) with two attributes name and email.

### 2. Publishing

By including the Promiscuous publisher mixin, we can publish the model attributes:

```ruby
# app/models/user.rb on the publisher app
class User
  include Promiscuous::Publisher
  publish :name, :email
end
```

### 3. Subscribing

Similarly to the publisher app, we can subscribe to the attributes:

```ruby
# app/models/user.rb on the subscriber app
class User
  include Promiscuous::Subscriber
  subscribe :name, :email

  after_create { Logger.info "Hi #{name}!" }
end
```

### 4. Replication

The subscriber must listen for new data to arrive. Promiscuous has a worker
that we can launch with the following command:

```
bundle exec promiscuous subscribe
```

You should start the subscriber *first*, otherwise the appropriate queues
will not be created. From now on, you should see the queue in the RabbitMQ
web admin page. Create a new user in the publisher's rails console with:

```ruby
User.create(:name => 'Yoda')`
```

You should see the message "Hi Yoda!" appearing in the log file of the subscriber.
